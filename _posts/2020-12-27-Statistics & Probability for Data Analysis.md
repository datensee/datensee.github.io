# Statistics
**Information** is intrinsic to every matter and process in this universe.Everything receives &/or emits information, explicitly &/or implicitly. And as a species with a strong sense for pattern recognition, we have been using statistics since long before we knew how to communicate (through a well defined language), to identify patterns and infer knowledge. The process is quite inherent to us, given the fact that we have, since the start of civilizations, started to incorporate mathematical models to understand and improve our data analysis methods.

## Meaning
**“Information based on a study of the number of something happens or is present, or other numerical facts”**

_source : “Statistics”, Cambridge Dictionary, https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/statistic_

Well, we can see the main focus is on numbers or the word “numerical”. But is there no way that data can exist without numbers? 
Of course it can. Gender of a person can be male or female, that does not require numbers to comprehend but when we are trying to store, analyse & visualize our data on our electronic machines which can be only communicated to using numbers & it requires a precise clarity on the on the the numeric types of data that are possible to work with.

## Conception

The first known application of a statistical method was pioneered by **John Graunt & William Petty**, who developed a model in as early as approximately 1662 C.E., to predict the population of London using the following data :
* 13,000 funerals per (1)year &
* 3 deaths per 11 families per (1)year
* Average family size was 8


It was estimated by their model that the population of London was around **384,000**.

### How was this estimation possible?

Let us assume that for every death, a funeral took place so that

Number of deaths = Number of Funerals

Then if,
* 3 deaths in per 11 families implies,
* 1 death per (11/3) families, & hence,
* 13,000 deaths per (11/3)*13000 families = 47666.67 families

47666.67 families = 47666.67*8 members = **381,333**

It is quite evident - as the concepts of mean, mode & median claimed their grounds in being our primary tools for analysis, a butterfly effect of revolution swept the data analysis paradigm. Secondary tools started building up around our primary tools giving us the power to explore the infinite possibilities and perspectives of data analysis and visualization.
