# Database
As we get overflowed with the data on a daily basis it has become crucial even for normal people other than data science enthusiasts to understand where all the data are stored, how they are managed and updated.

So where are these enormous amounts of data stored?
Data that is collected from our surrounding, activity, our work, customer, and everywhere else is stored in a database. A database is a collection of information that is organized in a way that makes accessing, updating, and managing the information easier. We require software or a system in order to access and manage the database which is known as Database management system(DBMS) and Database together with DBMS is called database system.

In general, there are variants of databases currently available among which we will be discussing the Centralized database system and Distributed database system in detail.

## What is a Centralized Database System?

A centralized database system as its name suggests has its storage centralized in one location. This means everything is stored and maintained in one place but can be accessed from a remote location through the network.

When databases are centralized it is relatively easier to manage them and it is cost-effective however this also comes up with the risk since a system failure at the main site where all data has been accumulated can lead to loss of entire data. Scalability is also another issue that needs to be dealt with while working on a Centralized database since it's not easy to bring change within such a database when the requirements demand.

## What is A Distributed Database System?

On the other hand, distributed database systems have multiple databases spread out in various sites to provide easy access from the network. The data is managed by DBMS in their respective site and data modifications at any site are updated universally. Since data is located on various sites, it requires synchronizing the data.

Scalability is one of the main reasons why distributed databases are more popular as it is very easy to adapt to changing requirements.

Though data is stored physically in various locations, distributed database systems provide a centralized experience to the user by hiding the existence of the network as well as the physical location of the data.

Its distributed nature also makes it fault-tolerant as if one system fails, data can be retrieved from the other working system however this ultimately leads to data redundancy and data inconsistency.

Distributed databases can be further categorized as Homogeneous Database and Heterogeneous database.

### Homogeneous database:
 In a distributed homogeneous database, all the databases located on different sites are identical in the sense that all the databases use operating systems, data management systems  and the data structure implemented is also uniform.

### Hetrogeneous database:
In contrast, In distributed  heterogeneous databases, different site uses different software, different data structures. Heterogeneous databases might also consist of variation on the software or application used in different computers in one site.

Survey on Centralized Database and Distributed Database

| Criteria | Centralize DB | Decentralized DB |
|----------|-------|--------------------------|
|Scalability| low| High|
|Data redundancy| Low | High |
|Fault Tolerance| No| Yes |
|Access Speed |Slow |Fast|
|Maintaining Data |Easier |Difficult|
|Cost |Less |More|


## Which Database is optimal for you?
Both centralized and Distributed Databases have their pro and cons however the choice of the database depends on the structure of your institute and the number of users. For single-user and institute like a university or an organization based in one location, a centralized database is an optimal choice due to it being cost-effective and easier to manage however for multiple users, and if the institute has several branches for example bank then Distributed databases is a better option.
